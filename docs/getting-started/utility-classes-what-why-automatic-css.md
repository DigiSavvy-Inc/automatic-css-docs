# Utility Classes: What & Why

Utility classes are like “presets” that help you change the style or behavior of elements quickly without needing to write css or change styles manually in a builder.

## Example

Let’s say you want to create a 3-column grid. In a builder like Oxygen, you have to do a lot of different things (and know how Grids work). And in CSS, you’d have to write a lot of lines of code.

But with utility classes, you simply add the .grid–3 class to a div and it transforms it into a 3-column grid.

What if you need to change your div to a 1-column grid at on mobile devices? That would require additional code or additional fiddling in the buidler.

But with a utility system like Automatic.css, you simply add .grid–s-1 to your div and it automatically transforms your 3-column grid to 1-column at the “S” breakpoint.
