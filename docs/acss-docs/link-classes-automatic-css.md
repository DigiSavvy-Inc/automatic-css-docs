# Link Classes

Link classes allow you to change the color of links. They can be applied to individual links, `<button>` elements, or parent elements (to affect all child links).

All link classes use the `.link--[color]` syntax and support all active core colors and shades as well as semantic colors.

Additionally, link classes can be overridden programmatically by targeting and overriding their output variables: `var(--link-color)` and `var(--link-color-hover)`.
