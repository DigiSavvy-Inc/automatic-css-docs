# Our Manifesto: The Perfect CSS Framework - Automatic.css

# Building the Perfect CSS Framework for WordPress Page Builders

Manifesto

CSS frameworks are popular because they enhance workflow, improve consistency, and reduce decision-making.

Unfortunately, most frameworks come with significant “cons.” They try to do too much, lack flexibility, create limitations, and create points of failure when used in a page builder environment (because they’re not designed for page builders).

Automatic.css is different. It has all the typical benefits of a framework plus a ton of additional benefits, with none of the downsides.

This is because ACSS was designed from the ground up as a next-generation framework for web designers who care about speed, consistency, customization, efficiency, scalability, and maintainability.

Just look at the “firsts” that ACSS brought to users:

The fact that other frameworks have scrambled to incorporate these features is a testament to their tremendous value. But, while innovative features can be copied, the reality is that competing frameworks can’t keep pace.

Our commitment to innovation and workflow enhancement is second to none, as is our commitment to support, education, and industry leadership.

When you buy ACSS, you’re not just buying a CSS framework. You’re buying true vision, an ecosystem, a tribe, a learning environment for web design best practices, unmatched support, and a brand new workflow that blows the socks off how you were working before.
