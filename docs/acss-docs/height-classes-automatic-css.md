# Height Classes

Height classes in Automatic.css set a minimum height on any element theyâ€™re applied to. We use a minimum height instead of a fixed height as best practice to prevent overflow issues.

Heights are available from 20 to 100 and are represented in vh units (e.g. .height--50 applies a minimum height of 50vh).

## Changing height at breakpoints

You can adjust the min-height at each breakpoint using our breakpoint height utilities. The convention is: .height--[breakpoint]-[value].
