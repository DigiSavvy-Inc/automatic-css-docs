# Header Padding Classes

It’s common to need to adjust the block padding in your header to create more or less white space. Knowing this, we’ve created utility classes specifically for doing this.

The naming convention for these classes is .header--{size}.

All of the typical t-shirt sizes are available.

Header padding classes are unique in that they don’t apply padding equally to all sides. They’re designed to maintain a consistent inline gutter while only adjusting the section’s block padding. They also follow the standard spacing system rather than the section spacing system, since headers don’t require the same amount of spacing as sections.
