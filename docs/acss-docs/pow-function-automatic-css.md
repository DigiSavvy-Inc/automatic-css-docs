# pow() Function

Note: Functions and mixins are designed for use in the Custom SCSS area of the Automatic.css dashboard. They will not work in the builder inputs or builder CSS.

This function is used for exponentiation. It raises any number to the specified power.

```
$my-pow: pow($my-text-size, 3);
Code language: PHP (php)
```

If the value of $my-text-size is 2.4, this statement is the equivalent of 2.43.

This function is most often used in scale-based calculations.

Result: 13.824

We’ll continue updating this documentation if more functions become available.
