The ACSS team made a strong push to fix all existing bugs in Linear before the end of the year. While this doesn’t mean ACSS is completely bug-free (no software is), it does mean that we’ve successfully squashed every single reported issue as of the publishing of this post.

For a product that’s 3+ years old, that supports multiple platforms, that continuously innovates, and that was completely rebuilt for v3.0 just months ago, that’s unheard of.

It’s what our users deserve, though. We’ll talk about this more in a moment. First, let’s talk about the last few months.

Rebuilding a complex plugin from the ground up to accomplish what no other framework has even attempted, across dozens of different development environments from builders to browsers and everything in between, definitely came with plenty of challenges.

It was more than worth it, though. ACSS is easier to navigate, easier to search, and easier to adjust and use.

We – [all of us] – now have a framework that is accessed from where we’re already working and it’s a tool that shows immediate feedback in real time. The “magic area” dragon that plagues so many front-end development tools has finally been slayed once and for all.

While the battle may have been a little messy, the important part is that we won. Our goal of having a stable, immediately responsive, real-time dashboard has been achieved.

So what happens now?

With all the really challenging work completed, it’s time for a new focus. Where 2024 was all about innovation, refactoring, and being bold in our vision, 2025 is going to be completely different.

Our three words for 2025 are “stability,” “simplicity,” and “support.”

Here’s our plan for hyper-focusing on these three areas:

## Stability

ACSS is a complex tool that’s very hard to automatically test-cover because it exists across multiple builder environments and can be used in an unlimited number of ways by users in different development environments and scenarios, with different browsers, and with various front-end implications.

While it’s impossible to completely test-cover ACSS the way some software might be fully test-covered with automation, we’re still going to take every possible step to ensure automated stability that goes far beyond manual testing.

## Simplicity

Great software translates “feature-rich” into “simple and easy.”

These are the primary questions we’re going to ask ourselves over and over again throughout 2025. We’re going to put less focus on new features and more focus on UX, simplification, and your workflow as a user.

## Support & Education

We already lead the industry in support and education, but we’re doubling down in 2025. Here’s how:

## We’re the industry-leading framework for WordPress by a wide margin and we plan to keep it that way.

No other framework for Wordpress comes close to ACSS in features, innovation, education, or user experience. The gap is wide and that’s well-reflected in the size of the user base and the number of active sites built with ACSS.

We’re very proud of this, but we also feel a growing sense of responsibility to (1) make sure there isn’t a single user that feels left behind by changes, updates, and innovations, and (2) make sure we’re actually helping you as a user, without setback.

Your main focus as a web developer is getting work done. This is how you keep customers happy and keep money coming in the door.

You use ACSS because it adds tremendous speed, consistency, and convenience to your workflow while dramatically reducing the number of decisions you have to make.

If the tool innovates and iterates too quickly, causing you to feel left behind, then we’re not helping you the way we should be. We’re mindful of this.

If the tool breaks something when you update and you have to take time to address it, then we’re not helping you the way we should be. We’re mindful of this.

Innovation, iteration, stability, and education all must be, and will be, delicately balanced.  This is the standard we seek in the products we use, so it makes sense that it’s also the standard we set for the products we create.

Thanks for an amazing 2024 and here’s to an insanely productive 2025!
