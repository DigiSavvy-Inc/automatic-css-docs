# Centering Classes

Centering classes are shortcut classes that allow you to center content quickly and easily and control the alignment of that content across all device sizes. It works by using Flex centering properties in combination with text-alignment properties.

Options are:

Breakpoint classes use a .center--[direction]-[breakpoint] syntax and are available for all active breakpoints.

The most common combination of centering classes is .center--all and .center--left-[breakpoint]. This would center everything on desktop and align everything back to the left at the desired breakpoint.
